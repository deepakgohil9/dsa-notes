### Question

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Optimal Approach

### Intuition

- **Single Variable:**
  - The code uses a single variable `out` initialized to 0.
- **XOR with Each Element:**
  - It iterates through the array `nums` using a for loop or range-based for loop (`for(auto it : nums)`) in this case.
  - In each iteration, it performs an XOR operation between `out` and the current element `it`. This XOR operation is assigned back to `out`.

### Code

```cpp [Single Number]
int singleNumber(vector<int> &nums)
{
	int out = 0;
	for (auto it : nums)
		out = out ^ it;
	return out;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
