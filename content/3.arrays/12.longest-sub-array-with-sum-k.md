title: Longest sub array with sum k
---

### Question

Given an array **arr** containing **n** integers and an integer **`k`**. Your task is to find the length of the longest Sub-Array with the sum of the elements equal to the given value **`k`**.

## Optimal Approach

### Intuition

1. **Initialization:**
   - Two variables are created:
     - `sum` to store the current prefix sum while iterating through the array.
     - `maxLen` to store the length of the longest sub-array found so far, initialized to 0.
   - An `unordered_map` named `m` is declared. It will store key-value pairs where the key is the prefix sum encountered so far, and the value is the index where that prefix sum was encountered for the first time.
2. **Special Case for Empty Sub-array:**
   - To handle the case where an empty sub-array (with a sum of 0) might be the longest sub-array with sum K, an initial entry is added to the map `m`: `{0, -1}`.
   - **Important Note:** Assigning `-1` to the index for an empty sub-array is a common convention but doesn't represent a real index in the array. It's a placeholder to mark the starting point (considered before the first element) for a sub-array with a sum of 0.
3. **Iterating through the Array:**
   - The code uses a for loop (`i`) to iterate through each element `A[i]` in the array `A`.
4. **Prefix Sum and Hash Table Update:**
   - The current element is added to the `sum` to get the current prefix sum.
   - The code checks if the current `sum` exists as a key in the `unordered_map` `m`.
     - If the key doesn't exist (`m.find(sum) == m.end()`), it means this is the first time encountering this specific prefix sum. So, it adds a new entry to the map with `sum` as the key and the current index `i` as the value. This stores the index where this prefix sum first appeared.
5. **Calculating Sub-array Length (if matching prefix sum found):**
   - If a matching prefix sum `sum - K` is found in the map (`it != m.end()`), it indicates a potential sub-array starting at the index stored in the map (`it->second`) and ending at the current index `i` that might have a sum equal to the target `K`.
   - The length of this potential sub-array is calculated by subtracting the index stored in the map (`it->second`) from the current index `i`. This difference represents the number of elements between the starting index of the matching prefix sum and the current element.
6. **Updating Maximum Length:**
   - The calculated length is compared with the current `maxLen`. Using the `max` function, it updates `maxLen` if the newly calculated length is greater. This ensures `maxLen` always holds the length of the longest sub-array found so far.

### Code

```cpp [Longest Subarray]
int lenOfLongSubarr(int A[], int N, int K)
{
	int sum = 0;
	unordered_map<int, int> m; // sum, index
	int maxLen = 0;
	m[0] = -1;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
	{
		sum += A[i];
		if (m.find(sum) == m.end())
			m[sum] = i;

		auto it = m.find(sum - K);
		if (it != m.end())
		{
			int len = i - it->second;
			maxLen = max(len, maxLen);
		}
	}
	return maxLen;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(nÂ²)`    |
| Space Complexity | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
