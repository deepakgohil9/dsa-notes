title: Sort colors
---

### Question

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Optimal Approach

### Concept

### Intuition

**Concept:**

This code utilizes a three-pointer approach called the "Dutch National Flag problem" to sort the colors in-place. It leverages three pointers (`low`, `mid`, and `high`) to partition the array based on color values.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Three integer variables are declared:
     - `low` (initialized to 0) represents the index where "0" (red) elements should be placed.
     - `mid` (initialized to 0) is the current index being processed.
     - `high` (initialized to n-1) represents the end of the unprocessed part of the array.
2. **Looping and Partitioning:**
   - The code uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `mid` is less than or equal to `high` (indicating elements to be processed remain).
   - Inside the loop, it checks the value at the current index (`arr[mid]`) and performs actions based on the color code:
     - If `arr[mid] == 0` (red):
       - It swaps the elements at `low` and `mid` indices. This effectively moves the "0" (red) element to the beginning (left side) of the processed part of the array.
       - Both `low` and `mid` are incremented to move on to the next element.
     - If `arr[mid] == 1` (white):
       - Since white elements stay in their place, only `mid` is incremented to move on to the next element.
     - If `arr[mid] == 2` (blue):
       - It swaps the elements at `mid` and `high` indices. This effectively moves the "2" (blue) element to the end (right side) of the unprocessed part of the array.
       - Only `high` is decremented to focus on the remaining unprocessed elements.
3. **Outcome:**
   - After the loop completes, the array will be partitioned into three sections:
     - The leftmost section (from index 0 to `low` - 1) will contain elements with the value "0" (red).
     - The middle section (from `low` to `high`) will contain elements with the value "1" (white).
     - The rightmost section (from `high` + 1 to n - 1) will contain elements with the value "2" (blue).

### Code

```cpp [Sort color]
void sortArray(vector<int> &arr, int n)
{
	int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1; // 3 pointers

	while (mid <= high)
	{
		if (arr[mid] == 0)
		{
			swap(arr[low], arr[mid]);
			low++;
			mid++;
		}
		else if (arr[mid] == 1)
		{
			mid++;
		}
		else
		{
			swap(arr[mid], arr[high]);
			high--;
		}
	}
}
```

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
