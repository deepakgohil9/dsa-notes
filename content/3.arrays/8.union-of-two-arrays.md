title: Union of two arrays
---

### Question

Given two arrays of size **n** and **m** respectively, find their union. The Union of two arrays can be defined as the **common** and **distinct** elements in the two arrays. Return the elements in **sorted** order.

## Optimal Approach for Sorted Arrays

### Intuition

**Two-Pointer Approach:**

1. **Pointers and Initialization:**
   - The code uses two pointers: `i` for the first array `arr1` and `j` for the second array `arr2`.
   - It creates a vector `Union` to store the elements of the union.
2. **Iteration and Comparison:**
   - The code uses a `while` loop that continues as long as both pointers haven't reached the end of their respective arrays (`i < n && j < m`).
   - Inside the loop, it compares the elements at the current positions (`arr1[i]` and `arr2[j]`).
3. **Three Cases:**
   - **Case 1 (Element from arr1 is smaller or equal):**
     - If the element in `arr1` (`arr1[i]`) is less than or equal to the element in `arr2` (`arr2[j]`):
       - It checks if the element is not already the last element added to the `Union` vector (`Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr1[i]`). This avoids adding duplicates.
       - If it's a new element, it pushes the element from `arr1` to the `Union` vector.
       - Then, it increments `i` to move to the next element in `arr1`.
   - **Case 2 (Elements are equal):**
     - This is a special case within Case 1. If the elements from both arrays are equal, only one of them is added to the `Union` to avoid duplicates.
   - **Case 3 (Element from arr2 is smaller):**
     - If the element in `arr2` (`arr2[j]`) is smaller:
       - It checks if the element is not already the last element added to the `Union` vector (similar to Case 1).
       - If it's a new element, it pushes the element from `arr2` to the `Union` vector.
       - Then, it increments `j` to move to the next element in `arr2`.
4. **Handling Leftover Elements:**
   - After the main loop finishes, there might be elements remaining in one or both arrays that haven't been processed.
   - The code uses two additional `while` loops:
     - The first loop iterates through the remaining elements of `arr1` (`i < n`). It checks for duplicates before adding them to the `Union`.
     - The second loop iterates through the remaining elements of `arr2` (`j < m`), again checking for duplicates before adding them to the `Union`.
5. **Return:**
   - Finally, the function returns the `Union` vector containing the combined and sorted elements from both arrays.

### Code

```cpp [Find Uninon]
vector<int> FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
{
	int i = 0, j = 0;  // pointers
	vector<int> Union; // Uninon vector
	while (i < n && j < m)
	{
		if (arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) // Case 1 and 2
		{
			if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr1[i])
				Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
			i++;
		}
		else // case 3
		{
			if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr2[j])
				Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
			j++;
		}
	}
	while (i < n) // IF any element left in arr1
	{
		if (Union.back() != arr1[i])
			Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
		i++;
	}
	while (j < m) // If any elements left in arr2
	{
		if (Union.back() != arr2[j])
			Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
		j++;
	}
	return Union;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average  | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n+m)`  | `O(n+m)` | `O(n+m)`   |
| Space Complexity | `O(n+m)`  | `O(n+m)` | `O(n+m)`   |

## Optimal Approach for Arrays (even unsorted)

### Intuition

1. **Set for Unique Elements:**
   - The code uses a `set` data structure. A set stores elements uniquely and automatically sorts them in ascending order.
2. **Adding Elements from Arrays:**
   - It iterates through both arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) using for loops (`i`).
   - For each element encountered (`arr1[i]` or `arr2[i]`), it inserts it into the `set`. Since sets don't allow duplicates, only unique elements will be added.
3. **Conversion to Vector (Optional):**
   - The code creates a vector `v` with a size equal to the number of elements in the `set` (`s.size()`). This step might be necessary if you specifically need the result in a vector format.
   - It then uses the `copy` function from the `<algorithm>` header (assuming it's included) to copy the elements from the `set` to the vector `v`.
4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the `v` vector (or the `set` itself if a vector wasn't created). Both will contain the unique elements from both arrays in sorted order, representing the union.pen_spark

### Code

```cpp [Find Uninon]
vector<int> findUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
{
	set<int> s;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		s.insert(arr1[i]);

	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
		s.insert(arr2[i]);

	vector<int> v(s.size(), 0);
	copy(s.begin(), s.end(), v.begin());
	return v;
}
```

| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O((n+m)log(n+m))` | `O((n+m)log(n+m)` | `O((n+m)log(n+m)` |
| Space Complexity | `O(n+m)`           | `O(n+m)`          | `O(n+m)`          |

While the set-based approach ensures sorted output, if order isn't important, we can optimize for speed using an `unordered_set`. It offers average constant time `O(1)` insertions, leading to an overall `O(m + n)` time complexity for finding the union of two unsorted arrays. This approach trades sorted output for faster processing.
