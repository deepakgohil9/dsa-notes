title: Remove duplicates from sorted array
---

### Question

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

## Optimal Approach

### Intuition

**Two Pointers Approach:**

1. **Pointers:** It uses two pointers:
   - `p1` (starting from 0) keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.
   - `i` iterates through the entire array.
2. **Comparison and Shift:**
   - If the current element (`nums[i]`) is not the same as the element pointed to by `p1` (meaning it's unique), it moves the element to the position pointed to by `p1` (effectively overwriting any duplicates before it).
   - Then, it increments `p1` to point to the next available unique element slot.
3. **Return Value:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, `p1` will point to the index just after the last unique element. So, `p1 + 1` represents the number of unique elements (`k`) in the modified array.

### Code

```cpp [Remove Duplicates]
int removeDuplicates(vector<int> &nums)
{
	int p1 = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
	{
		if (nums[i] != nums[p1])
		{
			p1++;
			nums[p1] = nums[i];
		}
	}

	return p1 + 1;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
