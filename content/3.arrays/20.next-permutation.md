### Question

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
- Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
- While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

## Optimal Approach

### Concept

This code utilizes the "Next Permutation" algorithm to find the next lexicographically larger permutation of an array in-place. It iterates through the array from right to left, searching for the first element (called `i`) that is smaller than its element to the right. Then, it swaps `i` with the next greater element found further to the right and sorts the remaining elements (from `i+1` onwards) in ascending order.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Two integer variables are declared:
     - `i` (initialized to `n-2`, where `n` is the size of the array) is used to iterate through the array from right to left.
     - `next` (initialized to `INT_MAX`) is a temporary variable to store the next greater element found for swapping.
2. **Finding the First Dip (Decreasing Element):**
   - The code uses a for loop (`i`) that iterates from `n-2` down to 0 (excluding the last element). This is because the last element cannot be involved in a swap to create a larger permutation.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (`nums[i]`) is smaller than the element to its right (`nums[i+1]`). This indicates a potential "dip" in the sequence where the next permutation can be formed.
3. **Finding the Next Greater Element:**
   - If a dip is found (`i` is smaller than `i+1`), another nested loop (`j`) iterates from `i+1` to the end of the array (`n`).
   - Inside the nested loop, it searches for an element `nums[j]` that is greater than the current element (`nums[i]`) and also smaller than the previously found `next` element. This ensures we find the closest (to the left) element greater than `nums[i]` for swapping.
     - If such an element is found (`nums[j]`), the `nextIndex` is updated to `j`, and `next` is updated with the value of `nums[j]`.
4. **Swapping and Sorting:**
   - If a next greater element is found (`nextIndex != i`), it signifies a valid swap to create a larger permutation. In this case:
     - The element at `i` is swapped with the element at `nextIndex` using the `swap` function.
     - The remaining elements from `i+1` to the end of the array (`nums.end()`) are sorted in ascending order using the `sort` function. This ensures the remaining elements are in the smallest possible order after the swap, forming the next lexicographically larger permutation.
   - Once a valid swap is found and completed, the outer loop (`i`) can be broken (`break`) as we've achieved the next permutation.
5. **Handling No Next Permutation:**
   - If the outer loop (`i`) completes without finding a valid swap (i.e., the array is already in descending order), it means there's no next permutation possible. In this case, the entire array is reversed using the `reverse` function to get the smallest possible order, which is the first permutation.

### Code

```cpp [Next Permutation]
void nextPermutation(vector<int> &nums)
{
	int i, n = nums.size();

	for (i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)
	{
		int nextIndex = i, next = INT_MAX;

		for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
		{
			if (nums[j] > nums[i] && nums[j] < next)
			{
				nextIndex = j;
				next = nums[j];
			}
		}

		if (nextIndex != i)
		{
			swap(nums[i], nums[nextIndex]);
			sort(nums.begin() + i + 1, nums.end());
			break;
		}
	}
	if (i < 0)
	{
		reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
	}
}
```

**OR**

```cpp [Next Permutation]
void nextPermutation(vector<int> &nums)
{
	next_permutation(nums.begin(), nums.end());
}
```
