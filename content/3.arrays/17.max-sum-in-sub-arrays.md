title: Max sum in sub arrays
---

### Question

Given an array **Arr**, with indexes running from **0 to N-1**, select any two indexes, **i** and **j** such that **i<=j-1**. From subarray **Arr\[i...j]**, find the **two smallest numbers** and add them, you will get **score** for that subarray. Your task is to return **maximum score** possible in the given array **Arr**.

## Optimal Approach

### Concept

Indirectly this question is same as the max sum of consecutive numbers because the two numbers will always be the smallest and second smallest for the subarray of two elements. They just made it tricky by asking for all subarray and adding min two element sum

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - A long long variable `maxSum` (initialized to `INT_MIN`) is used to store the maximum sum of the two smallest elements encountered so far. `INT_MIN` ensures any positive sum will be greater.
2. **Iterating through Pairs:**
   - The code uses a for loop (`i`) that iterates from 0 to `N-2` (excluding the last element). This is because it considers consecutive pairs `arr[i]` and `arr[i+1]`.
3. **Sum Calculation and Update:**
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the sum of the current pair `arr[i] + arr[i+1]`.
   - The code checks if this current sum is greater than the `maxSum`.
     - If it is, it means we've encountered a subarray with a smaller first element and a smaller second element (or the same element twice), leading to a larger sum for the two smallest elements.
     - In this case, the `maxSum` is updated with the current sum.

### Code

```cpp [Print Max Sum]
long long pairWithMaxSum(long long arr[], long long N)
{
	long long maxSum = INT_MIN;
	for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++)
	{
		if (arr[i] + arr[i + 1] > maxSum)
			maxSum = arr[i] + arr[i + 1];
	}
	return maxSum;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
