### Question

Given an array **arr\[]** sorted in ascending order of size **N** and an integer **K**. Check if K is present in the array or not.

## Optimal Approach

### Intuition

- **Initialization:** It creates a flag variable `flag` initially set to -1, indicating the element hasn't been found yet.
- **Iteration:** The code iterates through the array using a for loop (`i`).
- **Comparison and Early Exit:**
  - For each element `arr[i]`, it compares it with the target element `K`.
  - If they are equal (`arr[i] == K`), it sets the `flag` to 1 (element found) and breaks out of the loop. This early termination is possible because the array is sorted. If `K` is present, it won't be found in any subsequent elements due to the sorted order.
- **Return Value:**
  - After the loop completes, if the `flag` remains -1, it means the element wasn't found in the array. The function returns the final value of `flag` (either 1 for found or -1 for not found).

### Code

```cpp [Linear Search]
int searchInSorted(int arr[], int N, int K)
{
	int flag = -1;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
	{
		if (arr[i] == K)
		{
			flag = 1;
			break;
		}
	}
	return flag;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(1)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
