title: Second largest element in an array
---

### Question

Given an array **arr** of size **n**, print the **second largest** distinct element from an array. **If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.**

## Optimal Approach

### Intuition

- We track two variables: `first` (largest seen) and `second` (potential second largest).
- If a number is bigger than `first`, it becomes the new `first` and pushes the previous `first` (potentially the second largest) to `second`.
- We only consider updating `second` if the current number is greater than the current `second` but not as large as `first` (avoiding duplicates of the largest). This ensures `second` holds the true second largest distinct element, or -1 if none exists.

### Code

```cpp [SecondLargest]
int print2largest(int arr[], int n)
{
	int first = -1;
	int second = -1;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		if (arr[i] > first)
		{
			second = first;
			first = arr[i];
		}
		else if (arr[i] > second && arr[i] < first)
		{
			second = arr[i];
		}
	}
	return second;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
