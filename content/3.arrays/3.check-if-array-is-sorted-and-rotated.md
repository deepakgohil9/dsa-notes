title: Check if array is sorted and rotated
---

### Question

Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that A\[i] == B\[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.

## Optimal Approach

### Intuition

- **Counting Inversions:** The code iterates through the array, checking for inversions (`nums[i - 1] > nums[i]`). It keeps track of the number of inversions in a variable `count`.
- **Handling Rotated Array:** If the array is sorted and rotated, there can be one inversion at the rotation point (larger element before the smaller ones due to rotation). To account for this, the code also checks if the last element is greater than the first (`nums[n - 1] > nums[0]`). If it is, it adds one more to the `count` (assuming this is the rotation point).
- **Verdict:** Finally, the code checks if the total `count` of inversions is less than or equal to 1. If so, it implies there's at most one rotation point (valid sorted and rotated array). If `count` is greater than 1, there are too many inversions, and the array isn't sorted and rotated.

### Code

```cpp [Check]
bool check(vector<int> &nums)
{
	int n = nums.size();
	int count = 0;

	// Check if the array is non-decreasing
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
		if (nums[i - 1] > nums[i])
			count++;

	// Check if the last element is greater than the first element
	if (nums[n - 1] > nums[0])
		count++;

	// If the count of violations is less than or equal to 1, return true
	return count <= 1;
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`  | `O(n)`     |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
