title: Bubble Sort
---

### Intuition

-   In-place sorting algorithm.
-   Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Pseudo Code

1.  Set `swapped` flag to `false` (indicates if a swap happened in the current pass).
2.  For each element (i) from 0 to `n-2`:
    -   Iterate through the array (from 0 to `n-i-1`):
        -   Compare adjacent elements (`arr[j]` and `arr[j+1]`).
        -   If they are in the wrong order, swap them and set `swapped` to `true`.
3.  If `swapped` is `false`, the array is already sorted (break the loop).

### Code

```cpp \[Bubble Sort]
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	if (n <= 1)
		return;
	for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++)
	{
		if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
			swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
	}
	bubbleSort(arr, n - 1);
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n²)`   | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)`    |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |

::alert{icon="lucide:info"}
  In bubble sort, by tracking the number of swaps in a pass, you can optimize
  the best-case time complexity to `O(n)`. If no swaps occur in a pass, it
  signifies the array is sorted, and you can terminate the algorithm early. This
  reduces the time complexity from `O(n²)` to `O(n)` in the best case.
