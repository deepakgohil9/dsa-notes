title: Insertion Sort
---

### Intuition

-   In-place sorting algorithm.
-   Builds the final sorted list one element at a time by inserting each element in its correct position.

### Pseudo Code

1.  Iterate through the array from the first element (`i = 0`) to the second-last element (`n-2`): (We don't need to sort the last element)
    -   Pick the element (`arr[i]`). This element acts like the "key" to be inserted.
    -   Set a variable `j` to the current element's index (`j = i`).
    -   **While `j` is greater than 0 and the element before (`arr[j-1]`) is greater than the current element (`arr[j]`)**:
        -   This indicates the current element needs to be moved left (inserted before larger elements).
        -   Swap the current element (`arr[j]`) with the element before (`arr[j-1]`).
        -   Decrement `j` by 1 to move to the previous element in the (partially) sorted portion.
    -   At this point, `j` points to the correct position for the picked element (`arr[i]`). It's either 0 (meaning it's the smallest element) or the position where a larger element exists.

### Code

```cpp \[Insertion Sort]
void insertionSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		for (int j = i; j > 0 && arr[j] < arr[j - 1]; j--)
			swap(arr[j - 1], arr[j])
	}
}
```

### Complexity

|                  | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | `O(n²)` | `O(n²)`    |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`     |
